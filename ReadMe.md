# VBA Deliverable 2

## Project Overview and Purpose
The purpose of the project is to refactor/edit VBA code to collect information on certain stocks in the years 2017 and 2018.  We originanlly competed the process in our module but the goal was to increase efficiency of our macro.  The data we analyzed included 12 different stocks and our task was to retrieve ticker, totaly daily volume, and the return of each stock.    


## Results
Stock performance for the group was significantly better in 2017 than 2018.  Ten of the 12 stocks performed better in 2017 than 2018.  




The refactored script improved the performance of the macro by reducing the time to executed by .69 seconds for both 2017 and 2018.  

## Summary 
  Refacotoring makes code easier to understand and more organized.  This improves usability for others who may use or review the code at a later time.  Refactoring can also improve effficiency.  The largest Con is lacking the original context in which the code was written.

  Having written our original VBA script we knew the context in which it was written.  By refactoring we cleaned up the code and improved the organization.  We also decreased our run time by a significant amount, from .82 seconds down to .13 seconds.
